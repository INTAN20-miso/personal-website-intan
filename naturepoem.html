								<h1>Nature's Lullaby by Theo Williams</h1>
								<div class="a">Sounds of singing birds so early in the morning<br>
									Is a beauty in life that no one can adorn.<br>
									<br>
									Soothing peace of waves gently caressing the sand<br>
									Like embracing lovers, amidst placidity they stand.<br>
									<br>
									The scent of flowers, paint a smile on thy face<br>
									Surrounded by nature's love, most peaceful escape.<br>
									<br>
									Showered by warmth and richness from heavenly rays<br>
									Extracting the best of thy soul, glowing every day.<br>
									<br>
									Night befalls; the bright moon so tender<br>
									To nature's love and heart I surrender.<br>
									<br>
									I lay my head down and say goodbye<br>
									To nature's beauty; my sweet lullaby.

								<h1>Beauty And The Beast by Tango</h1>
								<div class="a">Nature is beautiful, quiet, and serene,<br>
									nature is the forest, with its many shades of green.<br>
									Nature is the birds, welcoming in the dawn,<br>
									nature is a calf, struggling to its feet as soon as it is born.<br>
									Nature is a salmon, swimming against the stream,<br>
									nature is a volcanic geyser, venting off steam.<br>
									<br>
									Nature is a beast, kicking up a storm,<br>
									nature is the trees, all bent, and broken, looking so forlorn.<br>
									Nature is lightning striking the ground,<br>
									nature is a forest fire, consuming all around.<br>
									Nature is a tornado, with its screaming roar,<br>
									nature is a tidal wave, washing every thing ashore.<br>
									Nature can be a beauty, and nature can be a beast.

								<h1>To Autumn BY John Keats</h1>
								<div class="a">Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<br>
									Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br>
								 Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br>
									With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;<br>
								 To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,<br>
									And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<br>
									   To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<br>
									With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,<br>
								 And still more, later flowers for the bees,<br>
								 Until they think warm days will never cease,<br>
									   For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.<br>
									   <br>
								 Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?<br>
									Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find<br>
								 Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,<br>
									Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;<br>
								 Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,<br>
									Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook<br>
									   Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:<br>
								 And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep<br>
									Steady thy laden head across a brook;<br>
									Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,<br>
									   Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.<br>
									   <br>
								 Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?<br>
									Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—<br>
								 While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,<br>
									And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<br>
								 Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn<br>
									Among the river sallows, borne aloft<br>
									   Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;<br>
								 And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;<br>
									Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft<br>
									The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;<br>
									   And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

								<h1>After Apple-Picking By Robert Frost</h1>
								<div class="a">My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree<br>
									Toward heaven still,<br>
									And there's a barrel that I didn't fill<br>
									Beside it, and there may be two or three<br>
									Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.<br>
									But I am done with apple-picking now.<br>
									Essence of winter sleep is on the night,<br>
									The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.<br>
									I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight<br>
									I got from looking through a pane of glass<br>
									I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough<br>
									And held against the world of hoary grass.<br>
									It melted, and I let it fall and break.<br>
									But I was well<br>
									Upon my way to sleep before it fell,<br>
									And I could tell<br>
									What form my dreaming was about to take.<br>
									Magnified apples appear and disappear,<br>
									Stem end and blossom end,<br>
									And every fleck of russet showing clear.<br>
									My instep arch not only keeps the ache,<br>
									It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.<br>
									I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.<br>
									And I keep hearing from the cellar bin<br>
									The rumbling sound<br>
									Of load on load of apples coming in.<br>
									For I have had too much<br>
									Of apple-picking: I am overtired<br>
									Of the great harvest I myself desired.<br>
									There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,<br>
									Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.<br>
									For all<br>
									That struck the earth,<br>
									No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,<br>
									Went surely to the cider-apple heap<br>
									As of no worth.<br>
									One can see what will trouble<br>
									This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.<br>
									Were he not gone,<br>
									The woodchuck could say whether it's like his<br>
									Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,<br>
									Or just some human sleep.
